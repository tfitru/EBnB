The water pressure in the shower was excellent, and the kitchen the necessities required to make some small meals. Street parking was also very easy to find in the neighborhood, which made checking in and leaving easy. Thank you for the wonderful stay!",

The living area had everything you needed and open to the bedroom.  They provide a microwave and a small refrigerator, as well as some snacks and water which we greatly appreciated.  Plenty of dresser and closet room too if you need it.  The bathroom is good too, really liked the large shower.   It is located practically on the PA/DE line and lots to do in the area if you are going the tourist route.  We were visiting family and friends and this suited our needs perfectly.",

Those small touches are really appreciated and very thoughtful. The location is perfect, very quiet. It is near a lot of shopping, restaurants, parks, and not far from the center of Wilmington.  We enjoyed the riverwalk downtown with all the music and restaurants.  We would come again!",

Didn’t have what I consider the bear essentials of an Airbnb, e.g., shampoo,  olive oil. Said it had a tub but there was no drain stopper for two bath times for my kids. The washer only has scalding hot water so colorful clothes beware. The neighbors motion security light goes off/on all night over south bedroom window. This light and wondering if someone was lurking around to cause it to go off/on made it impossible to sleep.",

      "response": "In regards to to Airbnb the bear essentials, if they took the time to locate the Canola oil and Olive, it was in the lazy Susan pantry. \r<br/>\r<br/>I don’t supply shampoo and bath soap due to allergies and I don’t want to be responsible for peoples  negative reactions if it doesn’t suit them. All of my customers bring their own. \r<br/>\r<br/>As for the bath tub stopper, there was one but not good enough for the customer. I went to Walmart and purchased a stopper and hair catcher and delivered it to the customer. I received a nasty note from the husband that it wasn’t the right one, and he would have to cut it to fit and etc…I expressed it was the only one available at the  store, thereafter received text which his message was rude & condescending.  I went to 2 other stores trying to locate another one. I went to Home Depot and purchased 5 different tub stoppers, contacted the customer and told him no one was home to intercept the stoppers. He gave me his wife’s cell, I called no answer. Instead, I knocked several of times, but no answer. I proceeded to put each stopper through mail slot and finally the wife opened the door, she had options to choose from and was happy with the one she selected. Mind you I delivered at 9:30pm!\r<br/>I cannot control my neighbors outdoor lighting. To improve this, I have purchased blackout curtains for my customers. \r<br/>\r<br/>The washer machine, installers didn’t put the hoses  in proper hot and cold spouts. This will be fixed very soon. \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall, I go out of my way for any customers request, if reasonable and I do what it takes to makrvmy customers happy. \r<br/>\r<br/>I guess you can’t please everyone all the time!",

Huge bathroom and the AC window unit was cranking. Everything I needed! The bed was comfortable and it was a quiet locale and home. It has a no frills feel, but a great value for the price. I would definitely stay here again. Kristin and her husband (and son!) were all friendly, easy to communicate with, and the place had a laid-back feel.",

The attention to detail in room adds to the personality and really encapsulates a modern farmhouse design. it's an ideal place to stay and travel from. I personally would stay here again when I have business in the area or when I want to have an escape. Highly recommended.",

Additionally, the other people there were nice and chill. And tip: there’s even a forest path through a side of the neighborhood which makes this spectacular. Overall, I’d recommend.",

Big plus the place has two king beds so both couples got to spread out. Very quiet and clean. Pool area was very well kept and perfect to lounge by. Totally fenced in yard (with posts AND chicken wire to protect for the smaller furry friends) was a huge plus. Our dog loved running around. Grill and kitchenette were perfect. Nicely air conditioned A++. Would def stay again.",

A terrific fenced in wooded space for our dog to run around in was a bonus! Arden is a unique community, and truly a gem. Heat and a/c worked well, and yes we needed both during the fickle weather we had. There is no washer or dryer; Susan recommended a great laundromat which we used twice during our stay which worked out fine. Susan is a marvelous host, and  we can tell she takes a lot of pride in giving her guests a welcome experience. We are already looking forward to our next visit!",

The house was clean and had everything we needed and when we did need something, Susan went out and got it right away. Wi-Fi worked great and we didn’t have any trouble getting on. The location in Arden is perfect for taking a short stroll around the neighborhood. The highlight of our stay was being able to walk to The Candlelight Theater to see Big Fish. If you stay at Susan’s, do yourself a favor and take a short walk down to the box office (great hours) and get tickets for this wonderful community dinner theater. You won’t be disappointed.",

I have no idea why she would say the location is not the safest other than she might have seen someone passing through that made her feel a little uncomfortable.  That can happen anywhere.I wonder if that happened in the grocery store would she then claim that the location of the grocery store is not the safe.... At no point during her stay when I checked in with her did she state any concern about feeling unsafe but did state that everything was good and thank me for checking up on her...",

      "comments": "I believe this location is unsafe for a single female traveling alone. I was told there was always parking outside of the home and both times I attempted to stay there was no parking within two blocks. If you think you want to stay make sure you check the place out before you book because the host will refuse to give even a partial refund to you even if you've booked for an entire month just a few days before your stay. When I looked up the crime rating around the home the surrounding streets are considered high crime areas so parking off that street and walking to the apartment is risky in my opinion.",

      "response": "I reject Sara's claim in its entirety. Every guest that have actually stayed would disagree with her assessment as well. Sara was all over the page long before visiting the property. She expected private parking when the listing clearly states street parking only.Parking is usually available in front of the house but when you show up on a Saturday evening in the middle of a pandemic parking right in front might be a challenge.Its amazing that Sara asked for a discount to fit her budget but refuse to park down the block, thats the classic definition of privileged. I think based on my intial conversation via text with Sara her issue was the block was too small for her truck. Perhaps if there was private parking for her dully truck she would have stayed.Maybe Sara should have booked a place with sufficient private parking for her truck.I imagine those places that could accommodate her dully truck as she put it would have been way outside of her budget. I think her supposedly fear of getting out of her car had everything to do with her and nothing to do with the area. Although Sara was not entitled to a refund I was going to give her a refund anyway but she failed to notify me in a timely manner thus blocking others from being able to book.",

The neighborhood is nice and quiet, and just minutes from I-95/495. The house is basic but clean and comfy. Heads up: there were exactly 4 bath towels. You may want to bring more. Same thing with blankets: each bed has a comforter, which was fine for us--but if you like to have extra blankets, you should bring your own.",

My only draw back was the opened food in the refrigerator, just due to Covid and sanitary reasons I expected items from other guest to be removed. I mentioned it to Steven and he was awesome as on providing an explanation.",

Her house was clean and she made sure to stop by often to tidy up and take out the garbage.  She provided a fully furnished kitchen. While I was at her house, DE underwent a heatwave, and when I mentioned to Florence that the AC wasn't working as efficiently, she made sure to call the AC people that same day and fixed the problem as soon as possible. She was located right off the high way in a cute little quiet suburban area, but a close enough drive to Wilmington and Newark. I was one of her first guests and at first she didn't have TVs in every single room. However after some guests commented on the lack of working TVs, she went out of her way to provide each room with one! Her price was reasonable for the area. As a traveling student, I mentioned to Florence that the next door neighbor was ridiculously loud, waking me up several days at 1:30 Am when I have to be up at 3:00Am. We then agreed setting up quiet hours so future guests may get some rest. I personally tried to talk to the incredibly rude neighbor several times, however she did not care. I would as a word of warning for any future hosts, highly NOT recommend her as a guest in your home. After my stay, I would recommend this airbnb for anyone visiting DE. I enjoyed my time so much that I am sending my current rotating classmates to Florence's place. Thank you for making my time in DE comfortable.",

Any minor issue that occurred (internet went down - the providers fault) he had resolved within hours.  <br/><br/>The property is amazing.  It was exceptionally clean upon arrival.  It is an amazing neighborhood that is very quiet and is across from a historic high school with a wonderful park and jogging track.  The neighbors are great.<br/><br/>The office space in the basement is great!  I work from home and it was perfect for video calls, good lighting and again, quiet.<br/><br/>The location is close to just about everything.  So, if you are thinking of staying in the area, you will not get a better host, a better property and a better location.<br/><br/>Thank you Carlis for an amazing stay.  I really appreciate the effort to making my stay a fantastic one!",

The kitchen was well stocked and the towels were fluffy and soft.<br/><br/>We knew that there was a jetted walk-in tub, but it was a little unclear what that meant from the description. It is a one person tub. Very deep and used in a seated position. It worked perfectly fine for solo showers or soaks - but don’t hope for a romantic bubble bath - which wasn’t promised - so not a complaint - just a clarification. <br/><br/>The pool was nice and had lots of chairs and areas to sit and relax. The floating solar light up balls were really pretty at night. The falling leaves were definitely making it a challenge to keep the pool clean. Though never enough that it wasn’t fine for a swim or to lounge around in the water. Which we did and thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>All in all, a great escape and we would definitely book again!",

Host Candace was even kind enough to assist me in getting some birthday goodies to have ready for my significant other to receive upon our arrival. Unfortunately we were not able to get in the pool due to debris left in it as a result of a rain storm. Just one little thing to note, the front door did not have shades or curtains covering its windows. Host Candace did however, go above & beyond in providing little extras to be sure we were set, like cleaning/sanitizing products, snacks, extra blankets & towels, and toiletries. Host Candace's place was peaceful & tucked away enough for serenity yet w/ easy access to restaurants, shopping centers, spas, etc. I would definitely recommend Host Candace's place.",

Nice and well kept house in a spacious lot with a swimming pool in the back. Entrance is separate from the main house, which is nice. Inside is very clean, updated, tasteful with some antiques. If the bed was a Queen size, it would have been more comfortable, but we managed and the mattress was very comfortable. Communication was very prompt and helpful. Thank you!",

But everything was heavily worn. The beds were falling apart and not much matched photos of bedroom.  I paid 425 for 4 days and I just don’t think that is a great experience for my first air BNB. Price wasn’t bad but now we know why.",

We found this place about half way from home and the bikes location. It's a little studio in a basement. It's beautifuly laid out. Had everything we needed. The only thing was that the shower was a little small. You will have a little trouble moving around if you are average size. Other than that, everything was perfect.  I definitely recommend staying here if you are in the area.",

The hosts composed an extensive booklet on how everything works, wifi codes, and such, which is most helpful for the guest.  The host raises chickens so fresh eggs were available.  The heat that weekend was unbearable, but the air conditioning worked perfectly and I was more than comfortable.  I definitely would stay here again and certainly recommend it.  The hosts communicate very well and quickly, which helps in the planning stages, and they are amenable to ensure the apartment is ready exactly as the guest wishes.",

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",
